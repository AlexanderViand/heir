On 2024-12-05, the HEIR team presented a talk aimed at giving researchers a
high-level overview of the HEIR project, brainstorming where new research might
be needed, and discussing how the HEIR team could help with research projects.

The [video recording of this talk](https://youtu.be/t_XHw7LVy8s) is on YouTube,
and this is the first video posted on the
[new HEIR YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@HEIRCompiler).
