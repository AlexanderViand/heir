# AI Documentation Enhancement

**Branch:** alex/add-claude-md **Status:** Complete and ready for merge/rebase
**Priority:** High - Foundational improvement

## Summary

Enhances HEIR's documentation for better AI-assisted development, specifically
targeting Claude Code. Adds comprehensive documentation for all MLIR passes and
a CLAUDE.md guide for AI assistants.

## What's Done

1. **CLAUDE.md file** (ef590187f)

   - Comprehensive guide for Claude Code
   - Build commands, testing workflows, architecture overview
   - Development patterns and file organization
   - Python frontend integration guidance

1. **Pass Documentation** (14d998adc)

   - Added 82 comprehensive pass documentation files
   - Each includes: overview, I/O specs, options, examples, usage guidance
   - Enhanced developer documentation in .td files
   - Added implementation notes and extension points

## What's Left TODO

- None - documentation is comprehensive and complete

## Issues & Review Comments

1. **Commit history**: Large diff includes files already modified on main -
   needs rebasing
1. **Documentation quality**: High quality, practical examples, clear
   explanations
1. **Organization**: Well-structured but could benefit from:
   - Cross-references between related passes
   - More complete pipeline examples
   - Visual diagrams for complex transformations

## Recommendations

1. Rebase on latest main to clean up diff
1. Consider adding diagrams for complex transformations
1. Add cross-references between related passes
1. This is ready to merge after rebasing

## Impact

This significantly improves developer experience and makes the codebase more
accessible to both human developers and AI assistants. The documentation quality
is exceptional.
