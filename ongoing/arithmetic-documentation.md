# Arithmetic Documentation

**Branch:** alex/documentation-updates **Status:** Early WIP - Needs significant
work **Priority:** Low - Documentation only

## Summary

Adds design documentation for arithmetic FHE pipeline/flow. Currently very
incomplete.

## What's Done

1. **Started design document**

   - Created `docs/content/en/docs/Design/arithmetic.md`
   - Basic outline structure

1. **Minor fixes**

   - Added `-p` flag to mkdir commands

## What's Left TODO

- Complete arithmetic design document ✗
  - Input program requirements ✗
  - Arithmetic restrictions ✗
  - SIMD paradigm explanation ✗
  - Pipeline stages and transformations ✗
  - Examples and use cases ✗

## Issues & Review Comments

1. **Very incomplete**: Document barely started
1. **Old base**: Branch has many unrelated changes
1. **Needs rebase**: Should isolate just documentation
1. **Content missing**: Most sections empty

## Recommendations

1. Rebase on latest main first
1. Complete all sections of arithmetic.md
1. Add diagrams showing pipeline flow
1. Include examples of transformations
1. Link to relevant passes
1. Consider if this is still needed given other docs

## Impact

Low priority - documentation would be helpful but implementation docs may be
more valuable.
