# Bazel OpenFHE Integration

**Branch:** alex/frontend-bazel-built-openfhe **Status:** Complete - appears
already merged or ready **Priority:** Medium - Developer experience improvement

## Summary

Enables HEIR frontend to use Bazel-built OpenFHE when no system-wide
installation exists. Improves developer experience by removing external
dependency requirement.

## What's Done

1. **Auto-detection logic**

   - Modified `frontend/heir/backends/openfhe/config.py`
   - Detects and uses Bazel-built OpenFHE
   - Falls back to system installation

1. **Development configuration**

   - Points to Bazel output directories
   - Updated `get_repo_root()` in `common.py`
   - Modified `heir_cli_config.py` for config paths

1. **Build system updates**

   - Adjusted `testing.bzl` for new configuration

## What's Left TODO

- None - implementation appears complete
- Branch is at same commit as main (may be merged)

## Issues & Review Comments

1. **Branch status**: Appears to be already merged or ready
1. **Testing**: Should verify auto-detection in various environments
1. **Documentation**: Could use setup guide

## Recommendations

1. If not merged, rebase and merge
1. Add documentation for developers
1. Test in clean environment without system OpenFHE
1. Consider adding CI test for this scenario

## Impact

Improves developer onboarding by removing external dependency requirement. Makes
HEIR more self-contained.
