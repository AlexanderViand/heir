# CGGI Rust Backend

**Branch:** alex/codex/extend-frontend-with-cggi-rust-backend **Status:**
Functionally complete but includes massive refactoring **Priority:** High - New
backend capability

## Summary

Adds a CGGI (TFHE-rs) backend to HEIR frontend, enabling compilation of MLIR to
tfhe-rs Rust code. However, the branch includes massive refactoring that should
be separated.

## What's Done

1. **New CGGI backend module** (`frontend/heir/backends/cggi/`)

   - Lowers MLIR to tfhe-rs Rust code
   - Compiles to Python module using maturin and pyo3
   - Encrypts inputs, runs homomorphic computation, decrypts results

1. **Infrastructure updates**

   - Added `.bazelignore` for virtual environment support
   - Updated dependencies and build configuration

1. **Major refactoring** (should be separate)

   - Removed SimFHE
   - Removed Kernel functionality
   - Removed NoiseCanEmbModel
   - Many other deprecated components

## What's Left TODO

- Core functionality appears complete
- Broader codebase TODOs:
  - TODO(b/287634511): Add list of partner companies/universities
  - TODO(#1162): Fix handling of signedness in integer types
  - TODO(#1174): Decide packing earlier in pipeline
  - TODO(#1565): Add support for Chebyshev-basis methods
  - TODO(#1595): Implement accurate cost model for layout optimization
  - TODO(#1597): Add linalg::reduce op kernel
  - TODO(#1888): Fix OpInterface verifier auto-run

## Issues & Review Comments

1. **Scope creep**: 198 files changed, 1339 insertions, 6955 deletions
1. **Mixed concerns**: New feature mixed with massive refactoring
1. **Testing**: Needs comprehensive integration tests
1. **Documentation**: Needs user documentation for the new backend

## Recommendations

1. **CRITICAL**: Split refactoring into separate PR
1. Add comprehensive documentation for CGGI backend usage
1. Create integration tests exercising full pipeline
1. Add examples showing when to use CGGI vs other backends
1. Document tfhe-rs version compatibility

## Impact

Significant new capability allowing HEIR to target tfhe-rs, but the mixed
refactoring makes review difficult.
