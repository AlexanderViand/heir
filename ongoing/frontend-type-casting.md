# Frontend Type Casting

**Branch:** alex/frontend-casts **Status:** Complete implementation
**Priority:** High - Usability improvement

## Summary

Enables MLIR types to be used as cast operations in Python frontend (e.g.,
`I1((x >> 7) & 1)`). Significantly improves frontend ergonomics.

## What's Done

1. **Cast syntax support**

   - Use MLIR types like `I1`, `I8` as cast operations
   - Works in both decorated and vanilla Python contexts

1. **Type system improvements**

   - Cleartext backend for CGGI scheme
   - `Boolean` type compatibility with `Integer`
   - Right shift operator (`>>`) maps to `arith.shrsi`

1. **Test coverage**

   - Comprehensive `cast_test.py`
   - Tests for various casting scenarios

## What's Left TODO

- Implementation appears complete
- Could add more cast operations for other types/schemes

## Issues & Review Comments

1. **Branch status**: Behind main, needs rebasing
1. **Documentation**: Casting semantics need explanation
1. **Type safety**: Ensure casts preserve correctness

## Recommendations

1. Rebase on latest main
1. Add user documentation with examples
1. Document casting semantics clearly
1. Consider adding more type conversions
1. Add examples to frontend tutorials

## Impact

Major usability improvement - makes Python frontend more intuitive and Pythonic.
