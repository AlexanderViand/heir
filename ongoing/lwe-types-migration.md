# LWE Types Migration

**Branch:** alex/codex/identify-blockers-for-lwetypes-migration **Status:** Core
migration complete, includes refactoring **Priority:** Medium - Infrastructure
improvement

## Summary

Identifies and fixes blockers for migrating to new LWE type attributes in the
CGGI dialect. Enables more flexible and extensible LWE type representation.

## What's Done

1. **Updated CGGI checks** (`lib/Dialect/CGGI/IR/CGGIOps.cpp`)

   - Support for new LWE attributes
   - Added conversion utilities for new attribute format
   - Fixed include dependencies

1. **Infrastructure updates**

   - Similar refactoring as CGGI backend branch
   - Removed deprecated components

## What's Left TODO

- Core migration support appears complete
- Same broader TODOs as CGGI backend branch

## Issues & Review Comments

1. **Built on refactoring**: Includes same large-scale cleanup as other branches
1. **Small actual changes**: LWE migration changes are minimal compared to
   overall diff
1. **Testing**: Needs specific tests for new attribute format

## Recommendations

1. Rebase on main after refactoring is merged separately
1. Add migration guide for downstream users
1. Add tests specifically for new LWE attribute format
1. Document the benefits of new attribute system

## Impact

Improves extensibility of LWE type system but actual changes are obscured by
refactoring.
