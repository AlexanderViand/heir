# OpenFHE to Scheme Pass

**Branch:** alex/j18805-codex/create-openfhe-to-scheme-pass **Status:**
Functionally complete with bug fixes applied **Priority:** High - Critical for
scheme abstraction

## Summary

Creates a conversion pass from OpenFHE operations to scheme-specific operations
(BGV/CKKS), enabling better optimization and backend flexibility.

## What's Done

1. **OpenfheToScheme conversion pass**

   - Converts OpenFHE ops to BGV/CKKS/LWE equivalents
   - Handles encryption/decryption operations
   - Converts packed plaintext operations
   - Supports rotation and relinearization

1. **Pattern-based conversion infrastructure**

   - Clean pattern matching approach
   - Integration with arithmetic pipeline
   - Multiple bug fixes (5 commits)

1. **Includes refactoring** (should be separate)

   - Same large-scale cleanup as other branches

## What's Left TODO

- Pass implementation appears complete
- May need additional patterns as new operations are added
- Same broader TODOs as other branches

## Issues & Review Comments

1. **Iterative fixes**: 5 fix commits suggest initial implementation had issues
1. **Test coverage**: Could use more edge case testing
1. **Mixed with refactoring**: Same issue as other branches
1. **Documentation**: Needs usage examples

## Recommendations

1. Squash fix commits for cleaner history
1. Add comprehensive test suite for edge cases
1. Separate from refactoring work
1. Add documentation showing when to use this pass
1. Create examples of OpenFHE â†’ BGV/CKKS transformations

## Impact

Critical infrastructure for abstracting away from OpenFHE-specific operations,
enabling multiple backend targets.
